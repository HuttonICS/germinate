help.accessions.browse=<p>The core data of Germinate evolves around accessions and their passport data. Passport data can be described as the sum of all meta-data that relates to the accession.</p><p>The main feature is the table that shows all accessions held in this instance of Germinate in a central location. The table supports column sorting and filtering as well as adding accessions of interest to the marked items list by marking the checkbox in the last column. The table itself shows the most valuable information about each of the accessions, which is a subset of the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors (MCPD).</p><p>The download section located below the table can be used to download the whole set of passport data including accession attributes for either the whole dataset, a group or a custom marked item list of accessions. Additionally, the pedigree information for the same constellation of accessions can be downloaded.</p><p>Selecting an accession in the table redirects you to the passport data page.</p>
help.accessions.for.location=<p>The table on this page contains all the accessions collected at the currently selected collecting site. Clicking on either the name or number will take you to the passport page of the selected accession.</p><p>The annotations panel below the table allows you to add annotations to the current collecting site. These comments will be public and consequently are visible to all users.</p><p>The download panel at the bottom of the page contains a link to download the data of this page for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/earth/" alt="Link to Google Earth">Google Earth</a>.</p>
help.climate=<p>This site shows climate information for all or a subset of the collecting sites. You can select climates from the first drop-down box and collecting site groups from the second drop-down box.</p><p>The histogram shows the minimal, average and maximal values per month based on either all collecting sites or a selected group.</p><p>If a collecting site group is selected, a detailed climate table and a collecting site map will be shown below the chart.</p>
help.dataset=<p>This page allows you to select the datasets for the export process.</p><p>The first stage is to choose the experiments that you are interested in. This is achieved by adding them to the "Analysis Set" by clicking on the checkbox next to the dataset.</p><p>Once you have selected the dataset or datasets you want to export data for select "Continue" to proceed to the next step in the export process.</p>
help.dataset.overview=<p>This page shows all the datasets that are visible to you within this instance of Germinate. They are split into internal and external datasets. Internal datasets can be visualized and exported from Germinate whereas we only link external datasets. Each table supports sorting and filtering. Selecting a dataset will take you to the specific page for this dataset.</p>
help.gbs=<p>The Flapjack program for visualizing genotypic data can be downloaded <a href="http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack/download-flapjack/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
help.genotype.result=<p>Your data should hopefully now been exported and are available in a number of formats.</p><p>This page ran the Flapjack conversion utility to convert the data exported on the previous page into Flapjack format.</p><p>To download the Flapjack installer for your operating system, please go to <a href="http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack/download-flapjack/" target="_blank">http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack/download-flapjack/</a>.</p><h4>For more information please visit the main Flapjack page <a target="_blank" href="http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack/">http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack/</a></h4>
help.genotype=<p>Now you have decided on the datasets for which you wish to carry out the export you now need to choose the accession and marker groups to export.</p><p>Step one is to choose the group of accessions you are interested in. Multiple groups may be selected at this stage using <kbd>Shift</kbd> or in the case of non contiguous selections <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>&#8984;</kbd>.</p><p>Now decide which marker group you require.</p><p>Next you need to decide if you need to use the CDF (Crap Data Filter). This filter removes markers which have above 50% missing data or markers for which more than 25% of the calls that we have for that marker and accession group combination consists of heterozygotes. Markers that are removed from the exported data can be examined on the next page.</p><p>The final stage is to choose the map you want to export the data against.</p>
help.geography=<p>The maps show different visualizations of the same location data. If the map contains markers, double-clicking on them will take you to a page listing the accessions collected at this site.</p>
help.groups=<h3>Groups</h3><p>In Germinate we define the concept of a group to be an arbitrary grouping of database items of a certain type. Germinate supports groups of <i>accessions</i>, <i>markers</i> and <i>locations</i>. These groups can be pre-created by an administrator or user-defined, which means that you can create your own groups (assuming user authentication is enabled).</p><p>The purpose of these groups becomes clear once you start exporting data. All types of data can either be exported for the whole dataset or the data can be subset into smaller chunks by selecting a single or a selection of groups. The exported data will then contain information about the selected groups only.</p><h4>Creating a group</h4><p><i>This section is only applicable if the Germinate instance you are using has user authentication enabled.</i></p><p>In addition to using the predefined groups, you can create new groups of your own. This page shows you all the existing groups in a table and upon selection, shows you its group members. New groups can be added and existing ones deleted by pressing the buttons below the groups table. Deleting a group requires you to select the checkbox in the corresponding table row as well as to have sufficient permissions to do so. When creating a new group you will be asked to select the group type and to decide on a name for the group. When you do so, the group will be associated with your user account.</p><p>Once this is done, the group will be created and Germinate will automatically select it and show the group members table (empty at this point) below the groups table. You can now manipulate the group itself by adding and removing members using the buttons below the table.</p><h4>Adding group members</h4><p>Adding members to an existing group can be achieved in two ways. You can upload a list of those items from a text file or your clipboard and Germinate will look these items up based on their identifier. Once found they will be added to the group. The other option is to use a boolean search feature that is similar to the way the table filtering works. You can choose fields from the database tables and specify values that the items in questions should equal, smaller or larger to.</p><p>Groups can be made public so that other users have the option to use them as well. If you decide to make your group public, toggle the switch button below the group members heading.</p>
help.home=<p>This is the main page of Germinate. It shows general information about this instance as well as an overview of the number of database items for certain types at the top of the page. Recent news about both the Germinate interface and the contained data are available in the news section shown in the bottom left. Finally, a section about other projects that are related to the project you are currently looking at are available in the bottom right.</p>
help.maps=<p>This page displays maps that are stored in the Germinate database that you are using.</p><p>After selecting a map in the table at the top of this page, you can export your map in a number of formats. Select an appropriate download link at the bottom of the page.</p>
help.megaenvironment=<p>This page shows information about collecting sites grouped by mega environments.</p><p>The first table contains a list of all mega environments with the number of collecting sites associated with this mega environment. Click on one of the items to get detailed information about this mega environment.</p><p>After having selected a mega environment, a map and table containing the associated collecting sites will appear at the bottom of the page.</p>
help.passport=<p>This page shows all the information related to a single accession. This includes the MCPD information, holding institute, synonyms, pedigree data, collecting site location, images, groups, datasets, additional attributes and finally there is a section where users can add annotations to this accession (if this feature is enabled available).</p>
help.phenotypes=<p>This page is used to export categorical data from Germinate.</p><p>Once you have chosen your dataset on the previous page you will be shown the categorical characteristics that we have for that dataset.</p><p>Choose which characteristics you want to export by clicking on them in the selection box. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select contiguous sections and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>&#8984;</kbd> for non contiguous sections.</p><p>The final stage of the export is to choose which group of accessions you want to retrieve the information for. Multiple groupings can be selected using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>&#8984;</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>. Press the "Continue" button to start the export process.</p><p>Once this is finished, you will see exported data at the bottom of this page as well as a link to download the data.</p>
help.trials.individual=<p>The first chart shows for a given site the value recorded at that site for this phenoytpe and year combination. There are as many bars as there are different treatments. The vertical lines represent the mean of all sites for each treatment.</p><p>Finally there are histograms showing the distribution of values for samples of each treatment. The bin size is set to 1 for each bin. Consequently, each bin contains the values of the range [x - 0.5, x + 0.5).</p>
