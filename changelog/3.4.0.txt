/* CHANGELOG */

  - ADD: Added table marking across pages to all location tables.
  - ADD: Added table marking across pages to all accession tables.
  - ADD: Added table marking across pages to all marker tables.
  - ADD: Added table marking across pages to all compound tables.
  - ADD: Added table marking across pages to all phenotype tables.
  - FIX: Fixed bug where not selecting a polygon on the polygon search page and hitting continue would thrown a database exception.
  - ADD: Since the last release the download of d3.js charts wouldn't include the legend. This was due to the fact that we moved the legend to an HTML div element, because it had significant advantages over having the legend as part of the SVG. This did, however, mean that the downloaded chart didn't include the legend. In this release we download the legend separately as a PNG (if the chart has a legend).
  - CHG: Increased paginated query performance and code readability by querying for the data and count in a single query.
  - ADD: Added subtaxa information to both accession tables and the passport page.
  - CHG: Simplified AnnotationsWidget by combining both count and data query into one single query.
  - DEL: Removed redundant Servlet methods.
  - CHG: Moved Logger configuration from code to logging.properties.
  - DEL: Removed logger code from exception sub-classes and added it to the base GerminateException.
  - FIX: Fixed compound data chart not showing up when there are too many accessions with compound data. This has now be restricted to only show the first 500 items. Plans for the future may include showing the items that are visible in the table above.
  - CHG: Cleaned up allele frequency data export code significantly.
  - CHG: Massively simplified the DatabaseObjectCache code.
  - CHG: Renamed all "Instance" classes to "Inst" and all "getInstance" methods to "get" to make the code more concise.
  - CHG: Renamed some RPC services to align them with the database table names.
  - CHG: Moved methods between RPC services to group similar methods closer together.
  - CHG: Removed old RPC service methods that can be replaced with calls to filterable methods.
  - CHG: Major code cleanup.
  - CHG: Massively reduced the number of different Exception classes that are used.
  - CHG: Replaced locations treemap with a new implementation.
  - ADD: Implemented a framework to import MCPD data into Germinate. A basic implementation of a tab-delimited MCPD data importer is included and further MCPD readers can easily be implemented to support more data types (e.g. json).
  - ADD: Added button to create group from shopping cart on the genotype/allelefreq export page without having to leave the page.
  - ADD: Added button to table marking context menu to allow the creation of a new group without having to leave the page.
  - CHG: Changed the default menu structure. If you're not happy with the new structure, feel free to customize it using the "Germinate.Template.CustomMenu" property in your config.properties file. Please consult the documentation for more details.
  - CHG: Replaced text-only pages with the new HTMLPage.
  - ADD: Added KML download for all accessions from the #geography page.
  - FIX: Fixed NPE when no datasets for a specific type are found.
  - CHG: Made email on Passport page clickable.
  - CHG: Made gallery support subfolders.
  - FIX: Fixed issue on Locations page where maps wouldn't reappear after disappearing.
  - FIX: Fixed issue where heatmap json data wasn't completely generated because the cache on the database wasn't large enough.
  - FIX: Fixed gallery not showing the images.
  - FIX: Fixed dataset statistics chart showing up empty when there's no data.
  - FIX: Fixed cookie page text.
  - ADD: Added new property to force thumbnails generated by the auto scaler to be square.
  - FIX: Fixed search query when no datasets present.
  - CHG: Reverted image scaler back to watching just the root directory.
  - CHG: Slightly changed the KML download for all accessions.
  - CHG: Fixed layout issue of logos on IE (because IE doesn't know how to render elements properly...).
  - CHG: Made Germinate more robust to Google Maps library loading errors.
  - FIX: Fixed an issue with the CurlyWhirly/Germinate interaction. The selections between the two tools weren't synchronized.
  - ADD: Added implementations of Excel data template importers (MCPD + attributes, phenotype data, pedigrees, markers + maps and genotypes).
